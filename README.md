CauseMap.org
============

CauseMap is a map of situations linked by cause.

1. Explain the situation
2. Explain the situations that cause it


Hopefully, causemap will one day be comprehensive enough to give an expansive idea for why many things happen. Eventually this dataset could be used to understand the human world.

CauseMap.org's software will be open source and the data will be open as well. Causemap will ask for donations. Perhaps down-the-line people will be able to start up their own mirror app-servers of causemap.org and contribute mirrors. The idea is to make the site so available that there would be no single point of failure, even in the event of a forced shutdown.
